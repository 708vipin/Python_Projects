Collect and verify accurate data, including:

Business name

Contact name and title (Owner, Real Estate, Development, or Operations)

Email and phone number

Website and address

Number of locations

Merchandising category

Deliver 30 verified leads per merchandising category (categories provided after hire).

Requirements:

Proven experience in data sourcing, lead generation, or list building (retail or restaurant experience preferred).

Skilled at using tools such as LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Apollo, ZoomInfo, Yelp, and Google Maps for research and verification.

Excellent attention to detail and ability to follow spreadsheet formatting guidelines.

Strong communication skills and ability to meet deadlines.

Deliverables:

Completed Excel spreadsheet containing 30 verified leads per merchandising category.

Each lead must meet the location and category criteria and include verified contact information.
