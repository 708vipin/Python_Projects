Summary
I already created a Google Sheet containing a list of real estate offices in Antwerp, including the city and office name.

Now I need additional data enrichment for each office.
You’ll use specific, pre-approved websites (listed inside the Google Sheet) to ensure the data is 100% accurate and verified.

⚠️ Only the sources mentioned in the sheet are allowed — do not use your own scraping tools or random data websites.

Data to collect (columns to fill in):
Full Address
VAT Number
Website URL
Owner Name
First Name
Last Name
Phone Number
General Email (e.g. info@...)
Personal Email (professional, not Gmail/Outlook)

Requirements:
Must be extremely detail-oriented
Must follow instructions exactly as written
Must cross-check data carefully (accuracy is more important than speed)

No AI-generated or guessed data — only verified information from official or provided sources

Good English communication

Deliverables:
Completed Google Sheet with all missing data fields filled in
100% verified and consistent formatting (no duplicates, no errors)

Additional notes:
There are 372 offices in total to complete.

The sheet already includes examples and detailed instructions under each column — read them carefully before starting.

If anything is unclear, ask before continuing. Mistakes or assumptions will not be accepted.

Budget & Deadline:
Fixed price (to be discussed based on accuracy and speed)
Short trial first (5–10 entries) — if accurate, we’ll continue with the full list.
